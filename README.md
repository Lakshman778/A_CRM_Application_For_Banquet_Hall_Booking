# A_CRM_Application_For_Banquet_Hall_Booking
Banquet hall booking involves the process of reserving a venue space for various events such as weddings, corporate gatherings, birthday parties, and other special occasions. This process typically begins with a client's inquiry about the availability of the banquet hall for their desired date and event type. The client discusses their event requirements including the date, expected number of guests, preferred layout, catering options, and any specific requests they may have. Based on the client's requirements, the banquet hall provides a detailed proposal outlining the available packages, pricing, inclusions, and any additional services or amenities. After the booking is confirmed, the banquet hall's event coordinator or planning team works closely with the client to plan and coordinate all aspects of the event. This includes finalizing event details, such as seating arrangements, menu selection, d√©cor preferences, audiovisual requirements, and any other special requests. On the day of the event, the banquet hall staff ensure everything runs smoothly, troubleshoot any issues that may arise, and provide assistance to the client and their guests as needed.


# Project Overview :


This project is to develop a comprehensive booking management system for a banquet hall business using Salesforce. The system will streamline the booking process, manage event details, and provide insights into sales and revenue. Additionally, it will include features to manage catering/menu selection, DJ services, decorations, themes related to weddings, and other marriage-related services. Implement flow to ensure data integrity and prevent double bookings.
